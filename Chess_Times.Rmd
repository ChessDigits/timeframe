## Synchrony Between Players

In chess, White and Black each play a move one after the other, alternating until the end of the game. In both over-the-board (OTB) and online games, players typically have a limited amount of time to play their moves.

Players typically spend less time in simple positions, and more time on more complex positions. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(r, breaks=50, main="Correlation between time taken by White and Black at each move", sub="Based on 10k games (Source: ChessDigits.com)", xlab = "Correlation (Pearson's r)", ylab="Number of Chess Games")
```
